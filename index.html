              Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March
              14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he
              later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later,
              they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau,
              Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic
              School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and
              mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired
              Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post,
              he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent
              Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.
