            Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March
            14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later
            on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved
            to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland
            and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in
            Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In
            1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship
            and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a
            position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905
            he obtained his doctor’s degree.
